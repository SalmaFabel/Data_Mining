# Pair Coding

Pair Programming requires two programmers to participate in a combined development effort on one job site. Each member performs an action that the other is not currently doing: While one codes the unit tests the other thinks about the class that will satisfy the test, for example.

The person who is doing the coding is given the controller name while the person who is directing is called the browser. It is often suggested that the two partners switch roles at least every half hour or after a unit test is done.

Ideally, the workspace should also accommodate the specific requirements of pair programming. Each worker must have their own mouse, keyboard and screen, which will always show the same information as the colleague's.

Somewhat less common is the method called remote pair programming. In this case, the programmers do not sit together, but are located in completely different places. For this method to work, you must have special technical solutions. Even despite the distance, colleagues must have a direct line of communication and must be able to access the code and view modifications in real time.

## Good practices in pair programming

In practice, this is usually a collaboration between two developers with different degrees of experience: thus, a more experienced worker can pass on their knowledge to their younger colleagues directly through practice. On the other hand, a younger worker may come up with other ideas, perhaps more innovative, that they can contribute to the project.

The working method is very useful mainly for large projects. The “four eyes” principle is especially effective when you have to deal with large amounts of code that also needs to be changed regularly. It guarantees that the best possible version of a fragment will always be inserted in the source text, reducing the amount of errors, so that it will not be necessary to make so many retouching. Post-monitoring of very long source codes requires investing too much time and effort, so it is best if these codes are established without errors from the beginning as far as possible.
