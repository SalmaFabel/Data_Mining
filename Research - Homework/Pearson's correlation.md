# Pearson's correlation

Pearson's correlation coefficient is a test that measures the statistical relationship between two continuous variables. If the association between the elements is not linear, then the coefficient is not adequately represented.

The correlation coefficient can take a range of values ​​from +1 to -1. A value of 0 indicates that there is no association between the two variables. A value greater than 0 indicates a positive association. That is, as the value of one variable increases, so does the value of the other. A value less than 0 indicates a negative association; that is, as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other decreases.

To carry out the Pearson correlation it is necessary to fulfill the following:

- The measurement scale must be an interval or ratio scale.
- The variables must be roughly distributed.
- The association must be linear.
- There should be no outliers in the data.

### How is it calculated?

To have a guide that allows:

- Establish the continuous variation of the two variables
- Compare the different cases with each other

To do this, the Pearson correlation coefficient is used, defined as the covariance that occurs between two standardized variables and is calculated with the following expression:

### How is Pearson's correlation coefficient interpreted?

Its dimension indicates the level of association between the variables.

- When it is less than zero (r <0) It is said that there is a negative correlation: The variables are correlated in an inverse sense.

High values ​​in one of the variables usually correspond to low values ​​in the other variable and vice versa. The closer the value to -1 said correlation coefficient, the more evident the extreme covariation will be.

If r = -1 we speak of a perfect negative correlation, which supposes an absolute determination between both variables, in a direct sense a perfect linear relationship with a negative slope coexists.

- When it is greater than zero (r> 0) It is said that there is a positive correlation: Both variables are correlated in a direct sense.

High values ​​in one of the variables correspond to high values ​​in the other variable, and in an inverse situation the same happens with low values. The closer to +1 the correlation coefficient is, the more evident the covariation will be.

If r = 1 We speak of a perfect positive correlation, which supposes an absolute determination between the variables, in a direct sense a perfect linear relationship with a positive slope coexists).

- When it is equal to zero (r = 0) It is said that the variables are incorrectly related, it is not possible to establish some sense of covariation.

There is no linear relationship, but this does not necessarily imply that the variables are independent, and there may be non-linear relationships between the variables.

When the two variables are independent they are said to be uncorrelated, although the reciprocity result is not necessarily true.
